# Pomidoro

Welcome to Pomidoro, a simple yet effective productivity app that I built for myself. It features a sleek dark mode interface that helps reduce eye strain and settings that save in local storage for convenience.

With Pomidoro, you can boost your productivity by breaking down your work into manageable time intervals, also known as pomodoros. This technique can help you stay focused and increase your efficiency, ultimately leading to better results.
